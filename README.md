# pradeep-sannamuri_-Image_Colour_Identification_AI

## Identifying the Image Color using AI and several machine learning metholodigies

This project uses AI to extract a set number of colors from an image. This project uses change the image size and image colour using AI. 
used libraries rgb2lab, matplotlib, deltaE_cie76, Kmeans. OBJECTIVES! To extract colors from a give image. To implement a KNN Algorithm 
on the given data to detect the color of the imported image.
We will extract the majority colors from the imported image. This will create the opportunity to search for images based on certain colors. 
We can select a color and if its hex matches or is close to the hex of the major colors of the image, we say its match.
Then we can say that we achieved the objectives of statement.
